# What's In Store

Whatâ€™s In Store is a tool for people to manage their inventories online. This app allows people to track their inventories, sales, and promotions. They may add and edit products, details, stock, and search their inventory by customizable categories and subcategories. They may track sales for each item and across all inventory, made easy with visual representations on their dashboard. This app will also allow people to set and follow their promotional sales: per item, price change, and time period.

## Getting Started

First, go to http://www.whats-in-store.net and on the left-hand side of the webpage, click `Get Started`. From here you will be prompted to set up your login credentials and shop information. Thereafter you will be redirected to your dashboard, which will eventually provide users with a visual representation of all stock and sales. As new users will not yet have an inventory to track, they are prompted here to add one. Users may easily navigate the website by clicking the navigation icon in the upper right-hand corner. 

### Prerequisites

Using this web portal requires no installation, though you may want to have an inventory in mind to add [and sales to track] in order to see the full potential of our What's In Store website.
