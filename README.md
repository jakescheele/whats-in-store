# What's In Store

Whatâ€™s In Store is a tool for people to manage their inventories online. This app allows people to track their inventories, sales, and promotions. They may add and edit products, details, stock, and search their inventory by customizable categories and subcategories. They may track sales for each item and across all inventory, made easy with visual representations on their dashboard. This app will also allow people to set and follow their promotional sales: per item, price change, and time period.

## Getting Started

First, go to http://www.whats-in-store.net and on the left-hand side of the webpage, click `Get Started`. From here you will be prompted to set up your login credentials and shop information. Thereafter you will be redirected to your dashboard, which will eventually provide users with a visual representation of all stock and sales. As new users will not yet have an inventory to track, they are prompted here to add one. Users may easily navigate the website by clicking the navigation icon in the upper right-hand corner. 

### Prerequisites

Using this web portal requires no installation, though you may want to have an inventory in mind to add [and sales to track] in order to see the full potential of our What's In Store website. 

## Notable Code Snippets

Please see our code snippets on CSS Animation, Add/Edit Variant, Categories, and Subcategories, filtering, and sorting below. 

### 1. CSS Animation

We created an animated shop using CSS animation properties. The animation uses keyframes to sequence through animation sequences, and the fade value to cycle through each components of the animation. Each keyframe uses a different opacity ranging from 0% to 100% to progress, as well as animation delays to time when each piece should start.

client/src/App.css

~~~~
.landingImage{
    padding: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px;
    margin: 0px, 0px, 0px, 0px;
}

.fadein{
    justify-content: center;
    display: flex;
    height: 10vw;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -60px;
    left: 200px
}
.fadein img {
    object-fit: scale-down!important;
    position:absolute;
    animation-name: fade;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-duration: 1.5s;
  }
  
  @keyframes fade {
    0% {opacity: 0}
    20% {opacity: 1}
    33% {opacity: 1}
    53% {opacity: 0}
    100% {opacity: 0}
  }
  ~~~~

###  2. Add/Edit Variant, Categories, and Subcategories 

These functions are using similar code. We used spread syntax to do add and updatee. The original codes are in client/src/pages/inventory.js

~~~~
updateVariant = (varientIndex, field) => value => {
    this.setState(
        {
            stock: this.state.stock.map((item, i) => i === varientIndex ? { ...item, [field]: value } : { ...item })
        }
    )
}
addVariant = () => {
    this.setState({
        stock: [...this.state.stock, { ...emptyVariant }]
    })
}
~~~~


### 3. Filtering

The logic of the filtering is get all product data from our database and save them in state on inventory page. At the same time we created a "filters" object on our state keeping category_id: true/false pairs inside. When a user check/uncheck a category, the function below will be triggered to reset the the value of a specific category id from true to false (or vice versa). Then, we call the handleSortedDom function which keeps tracking of the filters to fill the "filteredProducts" array on the state with products that belong to that specific category. The original codes are on client/src/pages/inventory.js

~~~~
handleCheckBox = (e) => {
        // get the checked cats's id 
        if (e) {
            const { name, checked } = e.target

            this.setState(prevState => {
                //set state with previous state key/value and change the checked key/value
                const filters = { ...prevState.filters, [name]: checked }

                // return the id of cats whose value is true
                const filteredCatsIds = Object.keys(filters).filter(
                    // condition: keys of filters obj which value is true (has been checked)
                    filterKey => filters[filterKey]
                )
                // filter the products arr in state with the filteredCatsIds
                const filteredProducts = prevState.products.filter(product =>
                    filteredCatsIds.some(
                        // condition checked catsId equal to product category id
                        filteredCatsId => filteredCatsId === product.category
                    )
                )
                return {
                    // return filters to actively monitor checkbox
                    filters,
                    // return the filtered products belonging to the checked cats
                    filteredProducts
                    
                }
            },()=>this.handleSortedDom())
        }
        else {
            this.setState(prevState => {
                //set state with previous state key/value and change the checked key/value
                const filters = { ...prevState.filters }

                // return the id of cats whose value is true
                const filteredCatsIds = Object.keys(filters).filter(
                    // condition: keys of filters obj which value is true (has been checked)
                    filterKey => filters[filterKey]
                )
                // filter the products arr in state with the filteredCatsIds
                const filteredProducts = prevState.products.filter(product =>
                    filteredCatsIds.some(
                        // condition checked catsId equal to product category id
                        filteredCatsId => filteredCatsId === product.category
                    )
                )
                return {
                    // return the filtered products belonging to the checked cats
                    filteredProducts
                    
                }
            })
        }
    }
~~~~

### 4. Sorting

The handleSorting function will keep track of the dropdown on inventory page and set the "sorting" state with the keywords of how we're going to sort the products (like price from low to high, for example). After we set the state, we call the handleSortedDom function which is basically a switch that take in the filteredProducts array and sort the products inside according to the keywords, and finally reset the filteredProducts array. The original codes are on client/src/pages/inventory.js
~~~~
handleSorting = (e) => {
        const { name, value } = e.target
        console.log(name)
        console.log(value)
        // set state
        this.setState({
            [name]: value
        },()=>{
            this.handleSortedDom()
        })
    }
   
handleSortedDom = ()=>{

    let products = [...this.state.filteredProducts]
    switch (this.state.sorting) {

        case "priceLtoH":
            console.log("ranging the dom priceLtoH")
            products.sort((a, b) => (a.price - b.price))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;

        case "priceHtoL":
            console.log("ranging the dom priceHtoL")
            products.sort((a, b) => (b.price - a.price))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;

        case "stockLtoH":
            console.log("ranging the dom stockLtoH")
            products.sort((a, b) => (a.totalStock - b.totalStock))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;

        case "stockHtoL":
            console.log("ranging the dom stockHtoL")
            products.sort((a, b) => (b.totalStock - a.totalStock))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;

        case "NameAtoZ":
            console.log("ranging the dom NameAtoZ")
            products.sort((a, b) => (a.name.toLowerCase() > b.name.toLowerCase() ? (1) : (-1)))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;

        case "NameZtoA":
            console.log("ranging the dom NameZtoA")
            products.sort((a, b) => (a.name.toLowerCase() > b.name.toLowerCase() ? (-1) : (1)))
            console.log(products)
            this.setState({
                filteredProducts: products
            })
            break;
        default:
            console.log("ranging the dom by default")
            this.handleCheckBox()
